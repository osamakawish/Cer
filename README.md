A foundation for a future company with several goals directed towards mathematics and computation. Geared towards OS-creation, universities, and compilers initially. As of Nov 28, a restaurant idea has been added. 

**OS-Creation.** I plan to devise an OS that also acts as a software on other computers. It will have a local component, that is only accessible on the given laptop, and a remote component, that is also accessible remotely. There's the third option of storing things only remotely, in order to save memory on the local device. 

**University.** This university will have a structure that is affordable and useful to its students. I do this by making students do some work for the university, based on their program. I also intend to include mandatory character building classes, as I generally like the concept of building character. 

**Compiler.** I intend to create a generic compiler that defines all concepts in a very simple sort of way. The compiler will have aspects of C++, along wih more additional concepts that will define all sorts of previous concepts in different but simpler ways. 

**Restaurant.** This is to act as a starting point for my earnings. I plan to introduce original food into a newly found restaurant.
